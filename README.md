# Sumo Code Snippets

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains code snippets that I have developed with the intention of automating some of the processes that I have come across when developing [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) simulation models. 

## 2. Usage

You are most welcome to use thesee code snippets for your projects. If you need any assistance, please write to me (thenuwantb@gmail.com). Also let me know if you think the codes/functions can be further improved.

## 3. Code Snippets
### 3.1 Matching traffic counts to the random routes generated by SUMO

This scripts is useful if you have actual counts at few edges of your network and you want to make a `.rou.xml` file that matches those counts. Here, the script `routeSampler.py` has been used.
